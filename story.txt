Once upon a time, there was a boy named Sir Lancelot. He was a fair knight
 who fought dragons and goblins. One day, a big, scary dragon came to the
 kingdom and stole the princess. Lancelot fought the dragon through a
 hard battle and saved the princess. They both lived happily ever after.

But... happily every after only turned out to be five years. Before the
dragon was slain by Lancelot, it had given birth to twin baby dragons that
witnessed the death of their mother. Swearing to take revenge, the two baby
dragons were filled with anger, hungry for the chance to one day kill Lancelot
when he was unaware. Lancelot had no idea what was coming his way...
