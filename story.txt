Once upon a time, there was a boy named Sir Lancelot. He was a fair knight
 who fought dragons and goblins. One day, a big, scary dragon came to the
 kingdom and stole the princess. Lancelot fought the dragon through a
 hard battle and saved the princess. They both lived happily ever after.

But... happily every after only turned out to be five years. Before the
dragon was slain by Lancelot, it had given birth to twin baby dragons that
witnessed the death of their mother. Swearing to take revenge, the two baby
dragons were filled with anger, hungry for the chance to one day kill Lancelot
when he was unaware. Lancelot had no idea what was coming his way...

Lancelot, now the commander of the knights, is enjoying the victory anniversary
party at the palace, as well as other citizens in the downtown. Suddenly,
the shadows move past the crowd. Looking up to the sky, a man found that
those shadows did not come from birds, but the twin dragons, which have grown
large enough to block the rays of the sun. They make a sudden turn in order 
to swoop down to the town. Series of loud noises of destruction then prompt the
elites to rush to the balcony and see what is happening...

The king of dragons, Agathor, is flying right outside of the castle. Demanding 
to see Lancelot for a final battle. lancelot draws his sword and agrees to a 
battle. Agathor flys towards him for battle and lancelot just smirks. Lancelot 
jumps, glides gracefully through the air, and slices agathors head. The place 
goes quiet... then everyone shouts in glee. "Lancelot", "Lancelot". The 
kingdom is safe once again, and lancelot is at peace. With another day 
successfully protecting his kingdom.
